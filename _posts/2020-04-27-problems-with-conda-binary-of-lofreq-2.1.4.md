title: Problems with Conda installation of LoFreq 2.1.4
---

A number of users have reported problems, which are somehow related to the Conda installed version
of LoFreq 2.1.4. We know for sure that installing from source solves the problem and that all users reporting the
problem are using the Conda installed version of LoFreq. Unfortunately, we haven't managed yet to reproduce the bug.

If you experience the same problem, please report details here: https://github.com/CSB5/lofreq/issues/89. In the meantime, please install LoFreq from source or downgrade the Conda version to 2.1.3
