title: Second Beta of LoFreq-Star Released
---
We've just released the second beta version of LoFreq-Star (AKA LoFreq 2.0)!
This second beta has kept us busy for a while and a corresponding webpage is
still missing, but we're working on it.
As before, just unpack the tarball and you can directly use the binary in ./
lofreq/lofreq (please do not change the directory layout or link to that
binary).
