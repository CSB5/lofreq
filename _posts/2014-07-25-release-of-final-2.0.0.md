title: Release of final 2.0.0
---
We've just released version 2.0.0, which includes an updated core logic to
handle all sources of errors separately, new default, high specificity settings
for the somatic SNV caller, support for parallel calls even on single
chromosome/sequence mappings and many tiny improvements and bug fixes. Note, we
had to change the arguments names of the 'call' subcommand. The usage document
has been updated to reflect this.
