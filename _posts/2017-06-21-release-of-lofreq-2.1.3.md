title: Release of 2.1.3 (maintenance release)
---

We've just released version 2.1.3 (it's been a while...). This version
brings a few minor changes: Python 3 support, a --force-overwrite
option to `call` and a best practices snakemake workflow. 

This is likely the last version 2 release. We've started a complete
rewrite which will make the tool much faster, dynamically compiles
against htslib etc.
