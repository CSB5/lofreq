title: Alpha testers for release 2.1 needed
---
We are looking for people interested in testing the current alpha for LoFreq
version 2.1. This version includes the ability to call (short) indels. Please
send an email to [me](mailto:wilma@gis.a-star.edu.sg) if you are interested, and
indicate operating system (if you need binaries) and a brief explanation of
what you're trying to do, so that we can give specific advice.

Once we get positive feedback, source-code and binaries will be released
publicly here.

Andreas

PS: We assume you already have BAM files (created with BWA or BWA-MEM), duplicates were removed, indels were realigned and base-qualities recalibrated (with GATK>=2).
