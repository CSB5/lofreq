title: Release of LoFreq 2.1.5
---

We just published version 2.1.5 of LoFreq. This is a pure bug-fix release that fixes a seven year old Heisenbug, surfacing only in recent conda builds and affecting version 2.1.4 in conda (see previous post and [Github issue](https://github.com/CSB5/lofreq/issues/89) for details). The bug was caused by a C string handling quirk (surprise), which produces undefined code and hence only showed up under special conditions (see this [Github post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1973572/can-the-input-and-output-strings-to-sprintf-be-the-same) for more).

A lot of people helped collecting details, which ultimately made it possible to find the bug. Especially Semion Leyn and Björn Grüning were instrumental. Thanks so much to all!
