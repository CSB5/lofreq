title: Version 0.5.0 released
---
Changes:
- We are now also using read mapping qualities. This is achieved by joining
      base-call (P_bq) and mapping qualities (P_mq): P_joined = P_mq + (1-
      P_mq)*P_bq
- Now using GNU autotools for compilation and installation (./configure &&
      make install)
- Now including a modified version of samtools mpileup
- Now including helper scripts to create a stringent, recalibrated mapping
      (bwa_unique.sh and base_qual_calib_wrapper.sh)
- Fixed mixup between --bonf options auto-ign-zero-cov and auto. The former
      is now default
- Added script lofreq_alnoffset.py which makes comparison of SNV calls made
      on different coordinate systems / against different reference sequences
      easier
