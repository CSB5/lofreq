This directory contains a sequencing data-set pooled from eight
clinical samples. The samples were made pseudoclonal before pooling by
very generously calling SNVs (and likely some FPs) by means of
LoFreq-NQ. Reads supporting SNVs were removed before pooling at
frequencies ranging from 12% to 0.16%. The setup is similar to
'Simulated population in Wilm et al. (2012), but here we frequencies
go lower, coverage is higher and strand-bias was explicitly removed.

* denv2-pseudoclonal.bam

  Mapping containing reads from eight haplotypes with varying
  abundance levels (87.50%, 12.50, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39 and
  0.20%).

* denv2-pseudoclonal_cons.fa

  The dominant/consensus/master reference sequence

* denv2-pseudoclonal_incl.bed

  BED file listing positions to use. All other position should be
  ignored as the limiting coverage in some haplotype samples did not
  allow to give the proper frequency/abundance level. Use as argument
  to samtools mpileup (-l)

* denv2-pseudoclonal_true-snp.snp

  True SNVs. Derived from the known haplotype consensus sequences and
  their pooling frequency.
