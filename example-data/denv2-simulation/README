This directory contains a simulated sequencing data-set used for
testing. The setup is similar to 'Simulated sequencing' in Wilm et
al. (2012), but here we used BWA for mapping.

* denv2-refseq.fa

  DENV2 reference sequence NC_001474.2

* denv2-haplotypes.fa

  Ten Mutants/Haplotypes generated from the rerence sequence by
  randomly mutating 0.1% of the positions (without replacement)

* denv2-10haplo.bam

  2688000 reads simulated with MetaSim using an error-profile derived
  from real sequencing and with quality values accordingly added.
  Reads mapped against reference sequence with BWA. Only uniquely
  mapping reads kept.

* denv2-10haplo_true-snp.snp

  List of True SNVs
