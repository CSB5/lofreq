VERSIONS
--------

0.2 (2012-07-12): Second release. Optimal LoFreq-Q implementation as described in
publication. SNV calls always against consensus, which is determined on-the-fly.
If consensus differs from ref, we call it consensus-variation. Used for producing
results in the Wilm (2012).

0.1 (2011-11-10): First release, initially hosted on github.
