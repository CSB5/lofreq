HOWTO
-----

Map your short reads against a reference genome (even better: a
consensus genome) using an aligner of your choice, e.g. BWA.

Optional, but recommended: extract a consensus genome from your
mapping and remap against ist.

Recalibrate quality scores in your BAM file with GATK. GATK will
expect a list of known SNPs as input, which you won't have in most
cases. Use lofreq_varpos_to_vcf.py to create a vcf file which can be
used for GATK.

Use lofreq_snpcaller.py to call SNPs from an [m]pileup created from
your BAM file with samtools (pipe into lofreq_snpcaller.py to save
some space). Since you're interested in very rare variants it's best
to increase the samtools coverage cap to a very high value (e.g. -d
100000). If you used a read mapping program that supports indels, you
better use samtools BAQ (default), otherwise you might want to try -E
or even -B.


SNV predictions created with lofreq_snpcaller.py should be filtered
afterwards with lofreq_filter.py, based on SNV quality/p-value,
strand-bias, coverage etc.


INSTALLATION
------------

You will need Python 2.6 or 2.7 including header files and a C
compiler to install LoFreq (some helper scripts in addition rely
scipy)

Simply try:
$ python setup.py install
which will build the source and install the necessary files

Type
$ python setup.py
for help

If you want to install lofreq into a different directory use the
--prefix flag.
