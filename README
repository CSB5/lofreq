LoFreq: A sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller for
high-throughput sequencing data


INSTALLATION
------------

You will need Python 2.6 or 2.7 including header files and a C
compiler to install LoFreq.

The following will build the source and install LoFreq:
$ python setup.py install

Type
$ python setup.py
for help

If you want to install LoFreq into a different directory use the
--prefix flag. You might then need to adjust your PYTHONPATH
environment variable as well.

-----

All script-names start with lofreq_ and print a simple help message
when invoked with -h.
