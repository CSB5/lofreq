and Niranjan Nagarajan <nagarajann@gis.a-star.edu.sg>


USAGE
-----

The main script is lofreq_snpcaller.py 

Try
$ lofreq_snpcaller.py -h
to get help.


INSTALLATION
------------

Simply try:
$ python setup.py install
which will build the source and install the necessary files

Type
$ python setup.py
for help

If you want to install lofreq into a different directory use the --prefix
flag. You can influence compiler options with the CFLAGS and
LDFLAGS environment variables

If things go wrong it's probably best to delete the ./build directory before
trying again
