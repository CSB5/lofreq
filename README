LoFreq-Star: A sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller
for high-throughput sequencing data



INSTALLATION
============

We assume you have downloaded the (precompiled) package of LoFreq-Star
and have a working Python 2.7. interpreter installed on your system.

Unpack the tarball and copy it where you like (preserving the
directory structure).

To call LoFreq you can either use the full path to the directory in
which the lofreq binary resides (./lofreq/lofreq). Or add that
directory to your PATH environment variable so that you only have to
type 'lofreq' to execute it.

If you for example, have the package copied to
/home/id/src/lofreq-version/ then you can either use the full path
/home/id/src/lofreq-version/lofreq/lofreq to call LoFreq or use the
following command under bash to add it to your PATH:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:/home/id/src/lofreq-version/lofreq/

NOTE: keep the directory structure as it is and do not copy the binary
alone somewhere else. You can however simply create a link to the
lofreq binary if you like.



USAGE
=====

The main command is called 'lofreq', which has several sub-commands.

Simply typing

    $ lofreq

will display a list of available commands:

    Usage: lofreq <command> [options]

      Main Commands:
        call        : Call variants
        somatic     : Call somatic variants

      Other Commands:
        filter      : Filter variants
        uniq        : Test whether variants predicted in only one sample really are unique
        plp_summary : Print pileup summary per position
        vcfset      : VCF set operations
        cluster     : Cluster variants in VCF file (supports legacy SNP format)
        version     : Print version info


You can simply call lofreq with one of the commands and its usage
information will be displayed.

The two most important commands are

- 'call' (to call variants)

and

- 'somatic' (to call somatic variants)

Note that predicted variants are already filtered using default
parameters (which include coverage, strandbias, snv-call quality etc)
