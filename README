LoFreq: A sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller for
high-throughput sequencing datasets


INSTALLATION
------------

You will need Python 2.6 or 2.7 including header files and a C
compiler to install LoFreq (some helper scripts in addition rely
scipy)

Simply try:
$ python setup.py install
which will build the source and install the necessary files

Type
$ python setup.py
for help

If you want to install lofreq into a different directory use the
--prefix flag. You might then need to adjust your PYTHONPATH
environment variable as well.


USAGE
-----

VERSION HISTORY
---------------

0.3 (2012-10-03):
- Made LoFreq chromosome aware
- Samtools pileup is now generated internally
- Added lofreq_diff.py script (input for lofreq_unique.py)
- Fixed bug in lofreq_bonf.py that would count exclude positions twice
- Added support for region bed files
- Removed scipy dependency

0.2 (2012-07-12): Optimal LoFreq-Q implementation as described in
publication. SNV calls always against consensus, which is determined
on-the-fly. If consensus differs from ref, we call it
consensus-variation. Used for producing results in the Wilm et al.
(2012).

0.1 (2011-11-10): First release, initially hosted on github.
