LoFreq-Star: A sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller
for high-throughput sequencing data

INSTALLING THE PRECOMPILED PACKAGE
==================================

We assume you have downloaded the (precompiled) package of LoFreq-Star
and have a working Python 2.7 interpreter installed on your system.

Unpack the tarball, cd into the newly created directory and run
binary_installer.sh. This will copy all necessary files to /usr/local
by default or a directory of your choice (see --prefix option). Note
that you might have to change your PYTHONPATH environment variable as
indicated by the script.

Alternatively you can simply copy the directory as it is somewhere
else (do not change the directory structure). To call LoFreq you can
then either use the full path to the directory in which the lofreq
binary resides (./src/lofreq/lofreq) or add that directory to your
PATH environment variable so that you only have to type 'lofreq' to
execute it.


USAGE
=====

The main command is called 'lofreq', which has several sub-commands.

Simply typing

    $ lofreq

will display a list of available commands:

Usage: lofreq <command> [options]

  Main Commands:
    call          : Call variants
    call-parallel : Call variants in parallel
    somatic       : Call somatic variants

  Other Commands:
    filter        : Filter variants in VCF file
    uniq          : Test whether variants predicted in only one sample really are unique
    plpsummary    : Print pileup summary per position
    vcfset        : VCF set operations
    version       : Print version info

  Extra Tools (if installed):
    vcfplot       : Plot VCF statistics
    cluster       : Cluster variants in VCF file (supports legacy SNP format)

  Samtools Clones:
    index         : Create index for BAM file
    idxstats      : Print stats for indexed BAM file

You can simply call lofreq with one of the commands and its usage
information will be displayed.

The two most important commands are

- 'call' (to call variants)

and

- 'somatic' (to call somatic variants)

Note that predicted variants are already filtered using default
parameters (which include coverage, strandbias, snv-call quality etc)
