LoFreq-Star: A sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller
for high-throughput sequencing data


INSTALLATION
------------

You will very likely have downloaded an already compiled version of
LoFreq-Star. Simply add the directory in which the LoFreq binary
('lofreq') resides to your PATH environment variable. Do not simply
copy it to your bin-directory, since this binary relies on a couple of
scripts in the package.


COMPILATION
-----------

You will need a C compiler and a Python 2.7 installation to compile
and use

See INSTALL for generic installation instructions.

The following will build and install LoFreq:
$ ./configure
$ make install

You will likely need to use sudo for the last step. If you however
don't have admin rights or want to install LoFreq into a non-standard
directory use the --prefix flag for configure. You will then very
likely have to adjust your PATH environment variable
as well. An example:

$ ./configure --prefix $HOME/local/
$ make install
$ export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH


USAGE
-----

The main command is simply lofreq, which has several subcommands.
Simply typing
$ lofreq
will display a list of sub-commands, the most importantly of which are
'call' (to call variants), 'filter' (to filter predicted variants) and
'somatic' (to call somatic variants). If you simply call lofreq with
one of the sub-commands usage information will be displayed.


VERSION HISTORY
---------------

LoFreq-Star is partially based on LoFreq (see
https://sourceforge.net/p/lofreq/ and
