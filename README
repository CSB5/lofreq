Installation instructions for the impatient
-------------------------------------------

Installation from source:
   $ ./configure [--prefix instdir]
   $ make install

Binary installation
    $ binary_installer.sh [--prefix instdir]

Both might need adjustments in your PATH (and PYTHONPATH) environment
variable.

After that simply type 
    $ lofreq
to get more help
