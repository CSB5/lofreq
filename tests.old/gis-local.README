Local notes to test installation on a specific host within GIS, not using
the shared installation:

Can't use /mnt/software/bin/python as this will change PYTHONPATH and always
point to the lofreq installation in /mnt/software.
Either use another python installation or install scripts, set PYTHONPATH
and use python-real

# install
host=gemini
find ~/local/$host/ -name \*lofreq\* | xargs -r echo rm -rf
cd /home/wilma/snpcaller/lofreq-git
make clean; ./configure --prefix=/home/wilma/local/${host}/; make -j; make install

# mod env
export PYTHONPATH=/home/wilma/local/${host}/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/mnt/software/stow/python_modules/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
export PATH=/home/wilma/local/${host}/bin:$PATH

# tests
grep '^#!' ~/local/${host}/bin/lofreq_*py | grep -v '-real$' && echo "WRONG INTERPRETER" 1>&2
# this is not the stow *installed* lib path. there should be no lofreq file there
python2.7-real -c 'import lofreq; print lofreq.__file__' && grep -q ${host} || echo "WRONG LOFREQ LIB" 1>&2

cd tests
bash run_all.sh 

NOTE: doctest.sh will fail because that's explicitely calling python
