- Align your reads with a good aligner. We recommend BWA-MEM. It's best to
  add a read-group (required if GATK is used later) during the alignment
- Recommended: For PE reads fix mate-pair information and clean BAM file
  (Picard's FixMateInformation and CleanSam)
(last two steps can be run with bwamem_wrapper.sh)

- Recommended for Illumina data: realignment with 'lofreq viterbi'.

- Mark PCR Duplicates with Picard's MarkDuplicates (Skip for high coverage amplicon data)
- Left alignment of indels with GATK's IndelRealigner. Untested alternative: Freebayes' bamleftalign)
- Base-quality recalibration with GATK's BaseRecalibrator (also adds indel qualities
  in versions >= 2). FIXME note about known.vcf
(last three steps can be run with ngs_pipeline.py)

- If LoFreq is used to predict indels and if BQSR was not run (i.e. indel qualities  are missing from the BAM
- file). Use
  'lofreq indelqual'

- Somatic:
  -l for targeted sequencign and exomes etc (see elsewhere)
  -d dbsnp. dbsnp matching your reference genome version. we recommend to remove
   variants marked as somatic (zgrep SAO=[23]) and variants found in cosmic from it.

- FIXME: lofreq parameters:
  source qual
  baq
  indel
  somatic
  parallel
