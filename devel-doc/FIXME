High Prio:
- predict indels

Med Prio:
- gzip support to lofreq uniq and vcf.[ch] output
- vcfset in c (gzip support as well)
- filtering script:
  
  as stand-alone (don't suck all vars into memory, for e.g. WGS)
  within

Prio 3
- uniq should add uniq filter and set columns accordingly (and also add dp4n for normal sample values)
- formats and samples support in vcf.py:VCFWriter (VCFReader already reads them)
- filter: use generator where possible (some filters might have to be applied standalone)
- enable pthreads in libbam:
    --- enable at compile time (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1699113/autoconf-with-pthread)
    --- how to set num_threads (only exposed to command line in view?)
    --- test!
- add internal sens test as in original version
- split lofreq_snpcaller cmd parsing: plp, snv, others (do they change argv?) 
- Implement test against old SNV caller
- Test actual SNV and SB values for both types of SNVs
- check for diffs between -l bed, -r region and none, all with and without BAQ
- Check what happens if fai or bai don't exist

In general:
- Replace scripts with C
