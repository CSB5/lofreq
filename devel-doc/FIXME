High Prio:
==========
- new release
  - fix license info in source
  - add external licenses for binary release

Med Prio:
=========

- new uniq logic
- what to do at high coverages? replace already read values randomly if above cap?
- parallel based on region bins instead of sequences so that this works in
  parallel per sequence as well (e.g. one chrom). beware of border effects.
  see also strelka's approach. 

Low Prio:
=========

- keep var info field with hash
- add normal and tumor plp info to somatic calls
- memory saving loading of ignore vcf per chrom (tabix)
- use samtools hash functions instead of uhash?
- memory saving loading of ignore vcf for source qual per chrom (tabix)
- support of indels during ignore vcf loading and source qual computation
- make source quality allele aware once we can handle (multi character) indels
- allow multiple ign vcf input
- put external licenses into sep folder (incl zlib) for binary release
- enable pthreads in libbam:
    --- enable at compile time (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1699113/autoconf-with-pthread)
    --- how to set num_threads (only exposed to command line in view?)
    --- test!
- add internal sens test as in original version
- split lofreq_snpcaller cmd parsing: plp, snv, others (do they change argv?)
- Implement test against old SNV caller
- check diffs between -l bed, -r region and none, all with and without BAQ
- get rid of all FIXME's
- gui?
