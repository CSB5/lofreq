High Prio:
==========

- add normal and tumor plp info to somatic calls
- fix license info in source and add external licenses for binary release
- use bgzip instead of gzip for vcf compression and SQ fetch or releveant (region,bed) vars per chrom (tabix/bgzip)

Med Prio:
=========

- replace uniq logic?
- what to do at high coverages where X>cap? replace already read values  randomly?
- profile code e.g.
  $LOFREQ call -f mers_coronavirus_NC_019843.2.fa --verbose --debug NC_019843.2:2399-2399 dwgsim-ion-samba-mers-100kX-pool.bwamem.bam

Low Prio:
=========

- keep var info field with hash
- use samtools hash functions instead of uhash?
- (done?) support of indels during ignore vcf loading and source qual computation
- make source quality allele aware once we can handle (multi character) indels
- allow multiple ign vcf input
- put external licenses into sep folder (incl zlib) for binary release
- enable pthreads in libbam:
    --- enable at compile time (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1699113/autoconf-with-pthread)
    --- how to set num_threads (only exposed to command line in view?)
    --- test!
- add internal sens test as in original version
- split lofreq_snpcaller cmd parsing: plp, snv, others (do they change argv?)
- get rid of all FIXME's
- gui?
