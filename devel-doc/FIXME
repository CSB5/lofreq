High Prio:
==========

- fix/check af computation for indels, esp. in presence of head/tails
- support of indels during ignore vcf loading and source qual computation


Med Prio:
=========

- what to do at high coverages where X>cap (e.g. Lewis' HepB)? replace already read values randomly?
- add normal and tumor plp info to somatic calls. normal could be added in uniq
- use indexing for source quality ignore vcfs if region was given

Low Prio:
=========

- keep var info field with hash
- profile code e.g.
  $LOFREQ call -f mers_coronavirus_NC_019843.2.fa --verbose --debug NC_019843.2:2399-2399 dwgsim-ion-samba-mers-100kX-pool.bwamem.bam
- parallelize viterbi avoiding overlapping reads. endpos of last read in last bin could be start pos for next bin
- multiprocessing version of alnqual (best per chrom as we get overlapping reads if run per bin)
