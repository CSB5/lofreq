High Prio:
==========

- fix indel af computation which seems off
- add normal and tumor plp info to somatic calls. normal could be added in uniq
- multiprocessing version of alnqual (best per chrom as we get overlapping reads if run per bin)

Med Prio:
=========

- what to do at high coverages where X>cap (e.g. Lewis' HepB)? replace already read values randomly?
- support of indels during ignore vcf loading and source qual computation

Low Prio:
=========

- keep var info field with hash
- support multiple ign vcf input
- split lofreq_snpcaller cmd parsing: plp, snv, others (do they change argv?)
- profile code e.g.
  $LOFREQ call -f mers_coronavirus_NC_019843.2.fa --verbose --debug NC_019843.2:2399-2399 dwgsim-ion-samba-mers-100kX-pool.bwamem.bam
- parallelize viterbi avoiding overlapping reads. endpos of last read in last bin could be start pos for next bin
