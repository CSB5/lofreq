High Prio:
==========
- finalize somatic
- predict indels

Med Prio:
=========
- gzip support to lofreq uniq and vcf.[ch] output
- filter to c
- ignore known vars in source qual
- pseudo parallel: iterating over regions given in bed (if given) or over chroms (if (len(chroms)>1))

Low Prio:
=========
- put external licenses into sep folder (incl zlib)
- add zlib to src?
- uniq should add uniq filter and set columns accordingly (and also add dp4n for normal sample values)
- enable pthreads in libbam:
    --- enable at compile time (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1699113/autoconf-with-pthread)
    --- how to set num_threads (only exposed to command line in view?)
    --- test!
- add internal sens test as in original version
- split lofreq_snpcaller cmd parsing: plp, snv, others (do they change argv?) 
- Implement test against old SNV caller
- Test actual SNV and SB values for both types of SNVs
- check for diffs between -l bed, -r region and none, all with and without BAQ
- Check what happens if fai or bai don't exist
- merge lofreq_core and core into one lib?
- get rid of PATH etc once python dep is killed
