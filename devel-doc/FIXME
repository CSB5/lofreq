Important:
- gzip support to lofreq uniq and vcf.[ch] output
- uniq should add uniq filter and set columns accordingly (and also add dp4n for normal sample values)
- Predict indels
- enable pthreads in libbam:
    --- enable at compile time (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1699113/autoconf-with-pthread)
    --- how to set num_threads (only exposed to command line in view?)
    --- test!
- add internal sens test as in original version

Some time:
- Replace Python scripts with C-version
- split lofreq_snpcaller cmd parsing: plp, snv, others (do they change argv?) 
- Implement test against old SNV caller
- Test actual SNV and SB values for both types of SNVs
- check for diffs between -l bed, -r region and none, all with and without BAQ
- Check what happens if fai or bai don't exist
