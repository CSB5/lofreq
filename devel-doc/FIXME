Important:
- Predict indels
- Fix unique logic
- enabled pthreads in libbam:
    --- enable at compile time (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1699113/autoconf-with-pthread)
    --- how to set num_threads (only exposed to command line in view?)
    --- test!
- add internal sens test as in original version
- add tests, tests, tests

Some time:
- Python eplace optionparser with argparse
- Gradually replace Python scripts with C-version (or include Python
- interpreter)
- split cmd parsing: plp, snv, others (do they change argv?) 
- Implement test against old SNV caller
- Test actual SNV and SB values for both types of SNVs
- check for diffs between -l bed, -r region and none, all with and without BAQ
- Check what happens if fai or bai don't exist?

Before release:
- Master configure/makefile cleanup
- update AUTHORS
- license update in all files
- Remove unnecessary stuff from lofreq_core
- diff all legacy scripts for changes
- remove gnu stuff incl autotools
- installation script
